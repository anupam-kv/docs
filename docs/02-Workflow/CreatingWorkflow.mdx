# Create Workflow

This page explains how to create a new workflow in **Siren** and gives an overview of the Workflow editor.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to My Workflow">
    After logging into Siren:

    Click **My Workflow** in the left navigation panel.

    - You’ll see a list of all existing workflows, including both **Drafts** and **Published**.
    - Use the **search bar** or apply filters to quickly find specific workflows by name, tag, or status.

    <Info>
      In the Workflow list, you’ll find **Clone** and **Duplicate** options under the **Actions** column.

      - **Duplicate Workflow** creates a copy of the selected workflow within the **same environment**.
      - **Clone Workflow** lets you copy the workflow to a **different environment**, such as from staging to production.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Workflow">
    Click the **\+ Add Workflow** button on the top right. This opens a modal where you need to enter:

    - **Workflow Name** – A unique name to identify your workflow.
    - **Description** _(optional)_ – Brief explanation of what the workflow does.
    - **Workflow Type** – Select **Basic** or **Advanced**.
    - **Tag** – Add one or more tags to organize and group related workflows.

    Click **Save** to continue.\
    You will now be redirected to the **Workflow Editor**, where you can begin building the flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Workflow Editor UI

Once you've created and saved a workflow, you'll enter the **Workflow Editor**, a visual interface where you can design, test, and configure your workflow.

At the **top-right corner**, you'll find the **Publish** button. Use this to make the workflow live once you're ready.

Near the **top-left**, beside the workflow name, you can access **Version History** to view or revert to earlier versions of the workflow.

## Editor Layout

The editor starts with a single **Start Node**, which is fixed and cannot be modified. All nodes are added from this starting point.

To add a new step, click the `+` icon below any node. This opens a list of available nodes (such as Wait, If, Switch, HTTP, Chat, Template or Provider). Depending on whether you've created a **Basic** or **Advanced** workflow, the available nodes may differ, but all compatible options are shown in the list.

> We cover node types and their behavior in more detail in the [Node configuration](../create-workflow) page.

When you're done building your flow, head to the **top-right corner** and click **Publish** to push the workflow live.

Need to check what changed or roll back to an older version? You’ll find **Version History** next to the workflow name on the **top-left** — perfect for tracking edits as your workflow evolves.

## Test Mode

You can toggle between **Editor** and **Test** mode at the top of the screen.

![Test Mode](/assets/images/editor/test-mode.png)

- **Editor Mode** lets you build and edit the workflow.
- **Test Mode** allows you to simulate how the workflow would run using mock data.

In **Advanced workflows only**, you'll see a **Test Code** panel on the left. This lets you run the flow with sample values and observe how the logic behaves.

Click **Run flow** to test the execution path in real time.

### Input JSON Panel

Whether you're in Editor or Test mode, you’ll have access to the **Input JSON** panel.

![Input JSON](/assets/images/editor/input-json.png)

The input JSON is divided into two keys:

- `data`: Custom data used inside nodes or for conditions
- `notify`: Recipient details mapped to various channels

In **Advanced workflows**, this JSON is editable. You can update values in real time to simulate dynamic content or branching conditions during testing.

Here’s an example structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "John",
    "event": "OTP"
  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "sms": "+911234567890"
  }
}
```
