# Create Workflow

This page explains how to create a new workflow in **Siren** and gives an overview of the different nodes you can configure within the editor.

## Navigate to My Workflow

After logging into Siren:

1. Click **My Workflow** in the left navigation panel.
2. Youâ€™ll see a list of all existing workflows, including both **Drafts** and **Published**.
3. Use the **search bar** or apply filters to quickly find specific workflows by name, tag, or status.

---

## Add a New Workflow

Click the **\+ Add Workflow** button on the top right. This opens a modal where you need to enter:

- **Workflow Name** â€“ A unique name to identify your workflow.
- **Description** _(optional)_ â€“ Brief explanation of what the workflow does.
- **Workflow Type** â€“ Select **Basic** or **Advanced**.
- **Tag** â€“ Add one or more tags to organize and group related workflows.

Click **Save** to continue.\
You will now be redirected to the **Workflow Editor**, where you can begin building the flow.

---

## Workflow Editor UI

Once you've created and saved a workflow, you'll enter the **Workflow Editor**, a visual interface where you can design, test, and configure your workflow.

### Editor Layout

The editor starts with a single **Start Node**, which is fixed and cannot be modified. All nodes are added from this starting point.

To add a new step, click the **`+`** icon below any node. This opens a list of available nodes (such as Wait, If, Switch, Template, HTTP, or Chat). Depending on whether you've created a **Basic** or **Advanced** workflow, the available nodes may differ, but all compatible options are shown in the list.

> We cover node types and their behavior in more detail in the [Create Workflow](../create-workflow) page.

---

### Node Configuration

Each node you add to the canvas opens a configuration panel when clicked. From there, you can:

- Select or attach templates
- Set static values (e.g., a 10-second wait)
- In Advanced workflows, use **variables** with JSON paths to dynamically configure node behavior
- Add conditional branches, fallback logic.etc

---

### Test Mode

You can toggle between **Editor** and **Test** mode at the top of the screen.

![Test Mode](/assets/images/editor/test-mode.png)

- **Editor Mode** lets you build and edit the workflow.
- **Test Mode** allows you to simulate how the workflow would run using mock data.

In **Advanced workflows only**, you'll see a **Test Code** panel on the left. This lets you run the flow with sample values and observe how the logic behaves.

Click **Run flow** to test the execution path in real time.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Input JSON Panel

Whether you're in Editor or Test mode, youâ€™ll have access to the **Input JSON** panel.

![Input JSON](/assets/images/editor/input-json.png)

The input JSON is divided into two keys:

- `data`: Custom data used inside nodes or for conditions
- `notify`: Recipient details mapped to various channels

In **Advanced workflows**, this JSON is editable. You can update values in real time to simulate dynamic content or branching conditions during testing.

Hereâ€™s an example structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "John",
    "event": "OTP"
  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "sms": "+911234567890"
  }
}
```
