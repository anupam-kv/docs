Control nodes help your workflow make decisions and branch based on conditions or variable values. Siren currently supports two types of control nodes:

- **If Node** — used for binary conditions (true/false paths)
- **Switch Node** — used for multi-branch routing based on values

---

## If Node

The **If Node** allows you to define one or more conditions, and split the workflow based on whether the condition(s) evaluate to **true** or **false**.

### Basic Workflow Configuration

In a Basic workflow, you can configure only **one condition**.

Each condition has the following fields:

- **Value A** – This is the **input source**, typically a JSON path pointing to data pulled from your system, database, or even a prior node.
- **Type** – The expected data type for comparison, such as `STRING`, `NUMBER`, or `BOOLEAN`.
- **Comparison Operator** – How you want to compare the two values. Options include `EQUALS`, `NOT EQUALS`, `GREATER THAN`, etc.
- **Value B** – The **reference value** you're comparing against. This is usually the value entered by the user or a static condition.

If the condition evaluates to true, the workflow continues along the **true** path. Otherwise, it follows the **false** path.

### Advanced Workflow Configuration

In an Advanced workflow, the If Node becomes more powerful. You can:

- Add multiple conditions
- Combine them using **AND** / **OR** logic
- Use dynamic data from external APIs or workflow input using JSON paths

> #### Example
>
> Imagine you're verifying a sensitive action like a payment or login:
>
> - A user submits their **OTP** during the verification process.
> - Your backend fetches the correct OTP from the database and passes it to Siren.
>
> You can configure the **If Node** like this:
>
> - **Value A**: `${workflow.input.user.otp}` (value retrieved from your database)
> - **Type**: `STRING`
> - **Operator**: `EQUALS`
> - **Value B**: `data.user_input_otp` (the OTP the user just entered)
>
> This checks if the submitted OTP matches the stored one.
>
> Now imagine you’ve added an **HTTP Node** earlier in the workflow that fetches fraud risk info for a user.\
> You can use that API’s response too:
>
> - **Value A**: `http.fraud_check.status`
> - **Type**: `STRING`
> - **Operator**: `EQUALS`
> - **Value B**: `approved`
>
> These conditions can then be combined using **AND** logic — so the workflow proceeds only if both checks pass.

## Switch Node

The **Switch Node** is used to split the workflow into **multiple paths** based on the value of a variable, similar to a `switch-case` logic in programming.

### Basic Workflow Configuration

In Basic mode, the switch has a **Name** field and allows defining up to **9 cases**, including a **default (fallback)** case.

![Switch Node - Basic](/assets/images/editor/switch-basic.png)

- Each case is a **static value**.
- You can route each case to a different set of nodes.
- The **default** route will be used if no match is found.

### Advanced Workflow Configuration

In an Advanced workflow, you'll see a **Switch Expression** field instead of a name.

![Switch Node - Advanced](/assets/images/editor/switch-advanced.png)

- Enter a **JSON variable path** (e.g., `data.channel`) to evaluate dynamically.
- Add up to 9 cases to match the expression.
- Just like in Basic mode, one fallback case is always present by default.

> #### Example
>
> Suppose you want to notify users based on their preferred channel.
>
> - Use `data.channel` as your **Switch Expression**
> - Add cases like `email`, `sms`, and `push`
> - Connect each case to the respective channel’s template node
> - Let the fallback case handle any unknown or missing channel values
>
> This allows you to streamline multi-channel workflows in a clean, organized way.
