## Wait Node

The **Wait Node** lets you pause the workflow before proceeding to the next step. This is useful when you want to introduce a delay or wait until a specific date and time before sending a message or continuing the flow.

When you click on the Wait Node, a configuration panel appears with a **Parameters** tab. Here, you can choose how the wait should be defined:

### Configuration Options

- **Duration:** Set a fixed delay using:
  - **Days**
  - **Hours**
  - **Minutes**
  - **Seconds**

  This option is ideal for introducing consistent gaps between workflow steps.
- **Until:** Define a specific **date and time** when the workflow should resume.
  - Select a **Time Zone** to align the timing with the recipient’s or system’s locale.

### Advanced Workflow Configuration

In **Advanced workflows**, an extra field appears below the static options:

- **Wait Variable**: A field to enter a dynamic wait value using a JSON path.
  - Example: `{{workflow.data.time}}`

This allows the wait duration to be determined at runtime, based on input data.

> If you use a **Wait Variable**, it will override whatever you set in Duration or Until. Just make sure the variable returns a valid time value — like a number in seconds or a proper date/time — so the workflow knows how long to wait.
