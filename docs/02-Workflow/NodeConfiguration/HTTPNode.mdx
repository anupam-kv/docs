<Note>
    This node is only available in Advanced Workflow
</Note>

Use the **HTTP Node** to call an external API during your workflow — for example, to fetch user data, verify an action, or enrich notifications with information from another service.

### Configuration Options

When you add an HTTP Node, you'll see the following fields:

- **Reference Name**: A label used to reference this API’s response in later parts of the workflow (e.g., `user_verification`).
- **Continue Workflow on API Failure**: If checked, the workflow continues even if the API call fails. Useful for optional or non-blocking requests.
- **Method**: Choose the type of HTTP request from the following options: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`.
- **URL**: Enter the **API endpoint link** you want to call.
- **Body**: Required for methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`. You can insert variables using JSON path.
- **Content Type**: Specifies the format of the request body: `application/json`, `text/plain`, `text/html`.
- **Accept Type**: Defines what response format you expect: `application/json`, `text/plain`, `text/html`.
- **Timeouts**
  - **Connection Timeout** – Time (in milliseconds) to wait for a connection to establish.
  - **Read Timeout** – Time (in milliseconds) to wait for the response after the connection is open.
- **Headers**: Add custom headers to the request using key-value pairs.

### Example

Let’s say you want to check if a user passed a fraud check before sending them a transaction alert.

Here’s how you might configure the HTTP Node:

- **Reference Name**: `fraud_check`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `https://api.example.com/verify`
- **Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "userId": "{{data.user_id}}",
    "phone": "{{data.phone_number}}"
  }
  ```
