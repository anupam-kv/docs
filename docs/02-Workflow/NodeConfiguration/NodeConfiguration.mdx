Earlier, we covered how to create a workflow and got familiar with the Workflow Editor. Now, let's take a closer look at how each **node** works.

Inside the editor, you build your workflow by connecting nodes — each representing a specific action, condition, or message step. To add a node, click the `+` icon below an existing one. Then click the node to open its configuration panel.

Each node allows you to define how that step behaves. You can:

- Set static values or attach message templates
- Add conditions, delays, or branching logic
- In **Advanced workflows**, configure nodes dynamically using **variables** with JSON paths

The sections below cover each node type in detail and explain the options available for configuration.
