The **Template Node** is used to send messages using predefined templates across supported channels such as Email, SMS, Push, WhatsApp, and more.

To learn how to create, edit, and manage templates, visit the [Templates](TemplatesOverview) section.

### Basic Workflow Configuration

In a Basic workflow:

- The **Parameter** section includes a **Template dropdown**.
- All available templates are listed.
- Templates that share the **same tag** as the workflow will appear **at the top** of the list for quicker access.

You simply select the desired template, and the message will be sent using that configuration.

### Advanced Workflow Configuration

In an Advanced workflow, the Template Node offers more flexibility:

- A **radio button** lets you choose between:
  - **Static**: Works the same way as Basic — choose a template from the dropdown list.
  - **Dynamic**: Use variables to dynamically select the template and its version during runtime.

Under **Dynamic**, you’ll see the following fields:

- **Template Variable**: Input field where you provide the JSON path to fetch the template name at runtime (e.g., `${workflow.input.data.template_name}`).
- **Template Version**: Optional field to specify a particular version of the template if needed.
- **Variable Object Path**: Defines the path to the variables object (e.g., `{{data.vars}}`) that will be substituted into the template during execution.

This makes it possible to personalize which template gets triggered — and what values are passed — based on real-time inputs.
