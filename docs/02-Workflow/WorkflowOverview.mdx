## Workflows

Workflows in Siren let you automate how notifications are triggered, routed, and delivered across channels. You can create flexible message flows that respond to events, include logic-based conditions, and adapt to real-time data ‚Äî all without writing any code.

Whether you're sending a simple alert or managing a multi-step communication journey, workflows give you full control over how each notification is delivered.

## Creating a Workflow

To create a new workflow:

1. Go to the **Workflows** section in the left navigation.
2. Click **‚ÄúAdd Workflow.‚Äù**
3. Enter a **name**, **description**, and assign a **tag**.
4. Choose between a **Basic** or **Advanced** workflow.
5. You‚Äôll be redirected to the **visual workflow editor**, starting with a **Start** node.

Use the **+** buttons to add and connect nodes that define how your notification flow behaves. You can define logic, route messages through different channels, apply conditions, and more.

Each workflow includes:

- **Editor mode** ‚Äì Drag-and-drop builder to define flow
- **Test mode** ‚Äì Toggle to test using simulated input
- **Input JSON** ‚Äì Define `data` and `notify` payloads to simulate real events
- **Publish** ‚Äì Push the workflow live
- **Version history** ‚Äì Track changes and revert if needed

## Basic vs Advanced Workflows

Siren supports two workflow types depending on the complexity of your use case:

### üîπ Basic Workflow

Use this when your logic is straightforward ‚Äî like sending a message after a trigger or branching based on user properties. Basic workflows include all essential nodes:

- **Wait Node** ‚Äì Delay execution between steps
- **If Node** ‚Äì Create yes/no conditions
- **Switch Node** ‚Äì Branch logic based on multiple values
- **Template/Channel/Provider Nodes** ‚Äì Select what to send and through which channel

Basic workflows are powerful on their own, especially for rule-based flows that don‚Äôt require third-party integrations.

### üî∏ Advanced Workflow

Advanced workflows give you everything in Basic, plus integration and AI capabilities:

- **HTTP Node** ‚Äì Make outbound API calls during the workflow
- **Chat Node** ‚Äì Add prompt-based logic or leverage your AI agent to dynamically decide what message to send

Use Advanced workflows when you need to:

- Call external APIs before continuing the flow
- Generate or customize content using AI
- Trigger actions based on real-time external data

By offering both types, Siren allows you to start simple and scale your messaging logic as your needs grow ‚Äî all within the same visual editor.
