## Workflows in Siren

Workflows in **Siren** let you design powerful, no-code automation for how notifications are triggered, routed, personalized, and delivered across multiple channels. They provide a flexible and visual way to build message flows that adapt to your logic and data, without requiring any engineering effort.

Inside the workflow editor, you can define a series of actions and decisions by adding nodes using a guided, point-and-click interface. Each node can be individually configured to control how and when notifications are sent, what data they use, and how the workflow behaves based on dynamic inputs.

Once your workflow is ready, you can **publish** it to make it live. Published workflows can then be triggered in two ways:

- **Via API**, by making a call to Siren’s `/trigger-workflow` endpoint — typically from your application backend or any system event you define.
- **Via the AI Agent Toolkit**, which can learn from documentation and intelligently trigger the appropriate workflow based on context.

API-triggered workflows are generally called when an event happens in your product, such as a user action or system update. The API payload includes details like the workflow name, recipient information, and any dynamic variables needed for personalization.

Whether sending a simple alert or orchestrating a multi-step notification journey, workflows in Siren give you the tools to automate and scale your communication strategy with complete control and visibility.

## Types of Workflows

When creating a new workflow in Siren, you choose between **Basic** and **Advanced** workflows. Both types leverage the same intuitive visual editor and provide the core features for building end-to-end notification logic. However, **Advanced workflows** unlock additional capabilities and offer greater flexibility for complex scenarios.

### Basic Workflow: Streamlined Automation

**Basic workflows** are perfect for straightforward automation flows. They're designed for simplicity and efficiency when your logic is predictable and doesn't require dynamic interaction with external systems.

Basic workflows support:

- **Wait Node**: Introduce delays between steps using a fixed duration (in days, hours, minutes, seconds).
- **Control Nodes**:
  - **If Node**: Branch your flow based on a simple true/false condition.
  - **Switch Node**: Route the workflow to multiple paths based on a predefined value.

Choose a Basic workflow when your automation needs are clear-cut and don't involve real-time external data or highly dynamic configurations.

### Advanced Workflow: Dynamic & Extensible Automation

**Advanced workflows** provide all the features of Basic workflows, plus powerful additions for more complex, dynamic, and data-driven use cases. They allow your automation to react to external systems and adapt to rich data inputs.

Advanced workflows include:

- **HTTP Node**: Make **API calls to external services**. You can use the response data to shape subsequent workflow logic, enabling seamless integration with your existing infrastructure.
- **Chat Node**: Facilitate human interaction by **pausing the workflow to await a recipient's response**. Define actions based on their reply or a timeout if no response is received.
- **Dynamic Variables across all Nodes**: Beyond fixed settings, you can use **JSON paths** to dynamically configure _any_ node's parameters based on real-time data from your workflow input or prior node outputs. For example, a **Wait Node** can dynamically set its duration based on a variable in your payload, or a **Template Node** can dynamically select which template to use.

Opt for an Advanced workflow when you're working with rich data inputs, need personalized flows, or require robust coordination and data exchange with external systems.

Now that you understand what workflows are, let’s explore how to [create and design one using the Workflow Editor](../create-workflow).
