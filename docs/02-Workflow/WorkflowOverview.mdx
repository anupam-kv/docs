## Workflows in Siren

Workflows in **Siren** let you design powerful, no-code automation for how notifications are triggered, routed, personalized, and delivered across multiple channels. They provide a flexible and visual way to build message flows that adapt to your logic and data — without requiring any engineering effort.

Inside the workflow editor, you can define a series of actions and decisions by adding nodes using a guided, point-and-click interface. Each node can be individually configured to control how and when notifications are sent, what data they use, and how the workflow behaves based on dynamic inputs.

Once your workflow is ready, you can **publish** it to make it live. Published workflows can then be triggered in two ways:

- **Via API**, by making a call to Siren’s `/trigger-workflow` endpoint — typically from your application backend or any system event you define.
- **Via the AI Agent Toolkit**, which can learn from documentation and intelligently trigger the appropriate workflow based on context.

API-triggered workflows are generally called when an event happens in your product — such as a user action or system update. The API payload includes details like the workflow name, recipient information, and any dynamic variables needed for personalization.

Whether you're sending a simple alert or orchestrating a multi-step notification journey, workflows in Siren give you the tools to automate and scale your communication strategy with complete control and visibility.

## Types of Workflows in Siren

When creating a new workflow in Siren, you can choose between **Basic** and **Advanced** workflows. Both types use the same visual editor and support the core set of features needed to create end-to-end notification logic — but Advanced workflows offer additional nodes and greater flexibility.

### Basic Workflow

Best suited for simple automation flows, Basic workflows support:

- **Wait Node** – Add a delay between steps using a fixed duration (in days, hours, minutes, seconds).
- **Control Nodes**:
  - **If Node** – Branch the flow based on a true/false condition.
  - **Switch Node** – Route to multiple paths based on a specific field value.

Basic workflows are ideal when the logic is straightforward and does not require real-time external data or dynamic configuration.

### Advanced Workflow

Advanced workflows offer everything available in Basic workflows, plus additional features for more complex, dynamic use cases:

- **HTTP Node** – Make API calls to external services and use the response to shape your workflow logic.
- **Chat Node** – Leverage Siren’s AI capabilities to generate content or perform actions based on your documentation.

Advanced workflows also support **dynamic variables** across all nodes. For instance:

- In the **Wait Node**, in addition to setting a fixed duration, you can use a variable from the input payload (via JSON path) to define how long to wait — enabling fully dynamic timing based on real-time data.

This makes Advanced workflows more powerful and adaptable when you're working with rich data inputs, personalized flows, or need to coordinate actions with external systems.
