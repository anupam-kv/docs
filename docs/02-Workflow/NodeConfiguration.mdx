## Configure Workflow Nodes

Inside the editor, you build your workflow by adding nodes. Each node represents a specific action or decision point. Click the **`+`** button to choose a node and then click on the node to configure it.

Hereâ€™s an overview of the different node types you may use:

---

### Wait Node

The **Wait Node** lets you pause the workflow before proceeding to the next step. This is useful when you want to introduce a delay or wait until a specific date and time before sending a message or continuing the flow.

When you click on the Wait Node, a configuration panel appears with a **Parameters** tab. Here, you can choose how the wait should be defined:

#### Duration

- Set a fixed delay using:
  - **Days**
  - **Hours**
  - **Minutes**
  - **Seconds**

This option is ideal for introducing consistent gaps between workflow steps.

#### Until

- Define a specific **date and time** when the workflow should resume.
- Select a **Time Zone** to align the timing with the recipientâ€™s or systemâ€™s locale.

---

#### Additional in Advanced Workflow

In **Advanced workflows**, an extra field appears below the static options:

- **Wait Variable**:
  - A field to enter a dynamic wait value using a JSON path.
  - Example: `{{data.waitTime}}`

This allows the wait duration to be determined at runtime, based on input data.

> If you use a **Wait Variable**, it will override whatever you set in Duration or Until. Just make sure the variable returns a valid time value â€” like a number in seconds or a proper date/time â€” so the workflow knows how long to wait.

---

### If Node

Conditionally branch the workflow based on a `true/false` evaluation.

- Define a boolean condition using a variable or fixed value.
- Use JSON paths like `{{data.isSubscribed}} == true`.

---

### Switch Node

Branch the workflow into multiple paths based on the value of a specific field.

- Provide a variable (e.g., `{{data.userType}}`) and define cases like "new", "existing", "premium", etc.
- A default path can be configured for unmatched cases.

---

### Template Node

Send a message using a pre-built template.

- Select a template from your existing list.
- Templates can contain placeholders like `{{data.name}}` which will be replaced using input JSON.
- Templates may include one or more channels (e.g., Email \+ SMS).

---

### HTTP Node _(Advanced only)_

Call an external API from within the workflow and use the response to inform later steps.

- Configure method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and body.
- Response data is stored and accessible for downstream nodes.

---

### Chat Node _(Advanced only)_

Pause the flow to wait for a recipient's response.

- Define the conditions under which the flow should proceed (e.g., on receiving a message).
- Set a timeout after which the workflow will exit or follow an alternate path if no response is received.

---

## ðŸ§ª Input JSON

In **Advanced workflows**, you can open the **Input JSON** panel from the top-right corner.\
This allows you to:

- View and edit the sample input structure
- Define the `data` and `notify` sections
- Test variable substitution in nodes using this input

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {

  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "priya@example.com",
    "sms": "+919999999999"
  }
}
```
