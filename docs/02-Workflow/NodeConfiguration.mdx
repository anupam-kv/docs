Earlier, we covered how to create a workflow and got familiar with the Workflow Editor. Now, letâ€™s take a closer look at how each **node** works.

Inside the editor, you build your workflow by connecting nodes â€” each representing a specific action, condition, or message step. To add a node, click the `+` icon below an existing one. Then click the node to open its configuration panel.

Each node allows you to define how that step behaves. You can:

- Set static values or attach message templates
- Add conditions, delays, or branching logic
- In **Advanced workflows**, configure nodes dynamically using **variables** with JSON paths

The sections below cover each node type in detail and explain the options available for configuration.

---

# Wait Node

The **Wait Node** lets you pause the workflow before proceeding to the next step. This is useful when you want to introduce a delay or wait until a specific date and time before sending a message or continuing the flow.

When you click on the Wait Node, a configuration panel appears with a **Parameters** tab. Here, you can choose how the wait should be defined:

#### Duration

- Set a fixed delay using:
  - **Days**
  - **Hours**
  - **Minutes**
  - **Seconds**

This option is ideal for introducing consistent gaps between workflow steps.

#### Until

- Define a specific **date and time** when the workflow should resume.
- Select a **Time Zone** to align the timing with the recipientâ€™s or systemâ€™s locale.

---

## Additional in Advanced Workflow

In **Advanced workflows**, an extra field appears below the static options:

- **Wait Variable**:
  - A field to enter a dynamic wait value using a JSON path.
  - Example: `{{data.waitTime}}`

This allows the wait duration to be determined at runtime, based on input data.

> If you use a **Wait Variable**, it will override whatever you set in Duration or Until. Just make sure the variable returns a valid time value â€” like a number in seconds or a proper date/time â€” so the workflow knows how long to wait.

# Control Nodes

Control nodes help your workflow make decisions and branch based on conditions or variable values. Siren currently supports two types of control nodes:

- [If Node](#if-node) â€” used for binary conditions (true/false paths)
- [Switch Node](#switch-node) â€” used for multi-branch routing based on values

---

## If Node

The **If Node** allows you to define one or more conditions, and split the workflow based on whether the condition(s) evaluate to **true** or **false**.

### Basic Workflow

In a Basic workflow, you can configure only **one condition**.

![If Node - Basic](/assets/images/editor/if-basic.png)

- Define a single condition with:
  - **Value A** (input)
  - **Type** (String, Number, Boolean, etc.)
  - **Comparison Operator** (Equals, Not Equals, etc.)
  - **Value B**

If the condition is met, the workflow continues along the **true** path. Otherwise, it proceeds along the **false** path.

### Advanced Workflow

In an Advanced workflow, the If Node becomes more powerful. You can:

![If Node - Advanced](/assets/images/editor/if-advanced.png)

- Add multiple conditions
- Combine them using **AND** / **OR** logic

#### Example

> Letâ€™s say you're validating a sensitive transaction and want to ensure both **OTP** and **CVV** are verified:
>
> - **Condition 1**: `data.otp_verified` is `true`
> - **Condition 2**: `data.cvv_verified` is `true`
>
> Combine them with **AND**, so the workflow proceeds only if **both** validations succeed.

---

## Switch Node

The **Switch Node** is used to split the workflow into **multiple paths** based on the value of a variable, similar to a `switch-case` logic in programming.

### Basic Workflow

In Basic mode, the switch has a **Name** field and allows defining up to **9 cases**, including a **default (fallback)** case.

![Switch Node - Basic](/assets/images/editor/switch-basic.png)

- Each case is a **static value**.
- You can route each case to a different set of nodes.
- The **default** route will be used if no match is found.

### Advanced Workflow

In an Advanced workflow, you'll see a **Switch Expression** field instead of name.

![Switch Node - Advanced](/assets/images/editor/switch-advanced.png)

- Enter a **JSON variable path** (e.g., `data.channel`) to evaluate dynamically.
- Add up to 9 cases to match the expression.
- Just like in Basic mode, one fallback case is always present by default.

#### Example

> Suppose you want to send a notification using the right channel based on user preference.
>
> - Use `data.channel` as your switch expression.
> - Add cases like `email`, `sms`, and `push`.
> - Connect each case to the appropriate Template Node.
> - Let the fallback handle any unexpected values.

# Template Node

Send a message using a pre-built template.

- Select a template from your existing list.
- Templates can contain placeholders like `{{data.name}}` which will be replaced using input JSON.
- Templates may include one or more channels (e.g., Email \+ SMS).

---

# HTTP Node _(Advanced only)_

Call an external API from within the workflow and use the response to inform later steps.

- Configure method (GET, POST, etc.), URL, headers, and body.
- Response data is stored and accessible for downstream nodes.

---

# Chat Node _(Advanced only)_

Pause the flow to wait for a recipient's response.

- Define the conditions under which the flow should proceed (e.g., on receiving a message).
- Set a timeout after which the workflow will exit or follow an alternate path if no response is received.

---

## ðŸ§ª Input JSON

In **Advanced workflows**, you can open the **Input JSON** panel from the top-right corner.\
This allows you to:

- View and edit the sample input structure
- Define the `data` and `notify` sections
- Test variable substitution in nodes using this input

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {

  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "priya@example.com",
    "sms": "+919999999999"
  }
}
```
