# Testing Workflow

In **Advanced workflows**, Siren provides a powerful **Test Mode** inside the Workflow Editor to simulate how your flow will execute in real-time.

To enter test mode:

- In the top navigation bar of the Workflow Editor, toggle from **Editor** to **Test**.
- You’ll now see an **Input JSON** panel on the left side of the screen. This allows you to modify and test with different input values.

> The Input JSON consists of two keys:
>
> - `data`: Custom values used inside the workflow, such as names, flags, or attributes used in conditions or variable substitution.
> - `notify`: Recipient details like email, phone number, or push token.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "OTP",
    "user_type": "premium"
  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "sms": "+911234567890"
  }
}
```

- You can edit the values in this panel freely to simulate how your workflow would behave with real data.
- Click Run Flow to test the execution. You'll see which path is taken and whether nodes succeed or fail.

<Note>
  In **Test Mode**, actual notifications are **not** sent — this is a dry run for validation and flow behavior.

# Triggering Workflow

After your workflow is tested and you're satisfied with its behavior, click **Publish** in the top-right corner to make it live.

Once published, a workflow can be triggered in two ways:
