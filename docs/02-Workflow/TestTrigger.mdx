# Testing Workflow

In **Advanced workflows**, Siren provides a powerful **Test Mode** inside the Workflow Editor to simulate how your flow will execute in real-time.

To enter test mode:

- In the top navigation bar of the Workflow Editor, toggle from **Editor** to **Test**.
- You’ll now see an **Input JSON** panel on the left side of the screen. This allows you to modify and test with different input values.

> The Input JSON consists of two keys:
>
> - `data`: Custom values used inside the workflow, such as names, flags, or attributes used in conditions or variable substitution.
> - `notify`: Recipient details like email, phone number, or push token.

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "event": "OTP",
    "user_type": "premium"
  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "sms": "+911234567890"
  }
}
```

- You can edit the values in this panel freely to simulate how your workflow would behave with real data.
- Click Run Flow to test the execution. You'll see which path is taken and whether nodes succeed or fail.

<Note>
  In **Test Mode**, actual notifications are **not** sent — this is a dry run for validation and flow behavior.
</Note>

# Triggering Workflow

After your workflow is tested and you're satisfied with its behavior, click **Publish** in the top-right corner to make it live.

Once published, you can trigger the workflow dynamically via API, either as a **single trigger** or a **bulk trigger**, depending on your use case.

## Trigger Types

### Single Trigger

Use this when you want to execute a workflow for a single recipient.

- Endpoint: `POST https://api.trysiren.io/api/v2/workflows/trigger`
- The `notify` field is an object
- The `data` field is shared context used throughout the workflow

#### Sample Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trysiren.io/api/v2/workflows/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{
    "workflowName": "otp",
    "data": {
      "subject": "otp verification"
    },
    "notify": {
      "notificationType": "email",
      "recipient": "example@example.com"
    }
  }'
```

### Bulk Trigger

If you need to send notifications to multiple recipients at once, **Bulk Trigger** is the way to go.

In a bulk trigger, the `notify` field is an array — each object in this array represents a unique recipient. The workflow runs once for each recipient object.

This is useful when sending messages like alerts, reminders, or promotions to a list of users in one API call.

#### Example

```json
{
  "workflowName": "otp",
  "data": {
    "subject": "otp verification"
  },
  "notify": [
    {
      "notificationType": "email",
      "recipient": "example@example.com"
    },
    {
      "notificationType": "sms",
      "recipient": "+1234567890"
    }
  ]
}
```
