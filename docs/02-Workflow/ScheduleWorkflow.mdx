# Scheduled Workflows

Siren allows you to schedule workflows to run automatically at specific intervals without manual triggers. This is useful for recurring tasks like sending daily reports, reminders, or maintenance notifications.

You can access the **Schedules** section from the left navigation panel under **Workflows \> Schedules**.

## Schedule List View

Once inside, you'll see:

- A list of all previously scheduled workflows
- A **Search** bar to quickly find a schedule by name
- Filters to refine the list
- An **\+ Add Schedule** button to create a new schedule

## Creating a New Schedule

Clicking on **\+ Add Schedule** will prompt you to enter a **Schedule Name**. Once added, you're redirected to the schedule configuration screen.

### Schedule Configuration Options

On the schedule creation screen, you’ll find the following input fields:

- **Workflow**: Select the workflow you want to schedule.
- **Time Zone**: Choose the time zone in which the schedule should run.
- **Starts**: Pick a date for the schedule to begin (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- **Runs**: Choose how often the workflow should run:
  - **Once** – Specify a time (`HH:mm` format).
  - **Daily** – Select a time, and optionally an end date.
  - **Weekly** – Pick specific weekdays and a time.
  - **Monthly** – Choose:
    - First day of the month
    - Last day of the month
    - Custom day of the month
- **Ends**: (only for recurring schedules)
  - **Never** – The schedule runs indefinitely.
  - **On** – Specify a date to stop the schedule.

### JSON Body

Users have the option to input a **JSON body** for the workflow trigger.

This JSON allows you to:

- Pass dynamic values to the workflow
- Provide user-specific data under the `data` object
- Specify recipient details under the `notify` object

Example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Ravi",
    "action": "login"
  },
  "notify": {
    "email": "ravi@example.com",
    "sms": "+911234567890"
  }
}
```

## Managing the Schedules

Once you've configured everything and click **Update**, the Schedule will be active

After scheduling:

- A Pause Schedule button will appear in the bottom right.
  - You can use this to temporarily pause the scheduled workflow without deleting it.
  - To restart it, click Resume and the schedule will continue from its configured timing.
- You can view all existing schedules and their current status in the **Schedule List**. To modify a schedule, simply click the Edit button next to it in the list.

  No actions can be performed for completed schedules.
