# Cohorts and Users

## What is a Cohort?

In Siren, a **cohort** refers to a specific group of users targeted with a common message.

These users are grouped together based on shared attributes or behaviors—such as sign-up date, location, activity, or custom tags. A cohort represents a segment of users that share a defined context or intent for communication.

For example:
- Users who installed the app in the last 7 days  
- Premium users who haven’t logged in this month  
- All users in a specific region

Cohorts enable personalized, context-aware messaging at scale—allowing efficient delivery of relevant content to the right audience without repeated manual segmentation.

## Types of User Cohorts in Siren

Siren supports multiple ways to define and manage user cohorts, giving teams flexibility to work with data from different sources.

### 1. Manual or UI-Based Cohorts

This is the simplest cohort type, suitable for one-off campaigns or when you're working with static user lists. Users can be:

- Uploaded via CSV
- Added manually through the Siren interface

This approach is ideal for teams who don’t need dynamic cohort updates or who are working outside of automated data systems.

### 2. Mixpanel Cohorts

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) is a leading product analytics platform used to understand user interactions within applications.

Siren integrates with Mixpanel to automatically import cohorts that have already been created there. This enables seamless targeting based on real-time behavioral data without duplication of effort.

For example, a cohort like _“Users who added to cart but didn’t purchase”_ in Mixpanel can be directly synced with Siren, allowing teams to send timely and relevant nudges or offers.

### 3. Datasource-Driven Cohorts

For teams that rely on internal databases or cloud data warehouses, Siren offers native integrations with common data systems including:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- **Warehouses**: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake  

These integrations allow you to define dynamic cohorts based on live production or analytical data, ensuring that your targeting is always up-to-date and reflective of real user behavior.

## Summary

Cohorts are a foundational concept in Siren, enabling smarter, data-driven engagement strategies. Whether you're managing user lists manually or syncing behavior-based groups from tools like Mixpanel or your own database, Siren gives you the flexibility to organize, segment, and communicate with users more effectively.
