Campaigns in Siren allow you to schedule and automate notifications with precision—ensuring timely, relevant communication with your users. Whether it's daily updates, one-time alerts, monthly reminders, or messages tied to specific events, campaigns help you deliver the right message at the right time.

With powerful features like datasource integration, flexible scheduling, and automated delivery, campaigns are built to support a wide range of use cases and audience segments. You can connect to platforms like PostgreSQL or Mixpanel to define your target users, set up recurring or one-time schedules, and monitor everything from a centralized dashboard.

Backed by detailed analytics and reporting, campaigns give you end-to-end control over your notification strategy—helping you maximize engagement and minimize manual effort.
