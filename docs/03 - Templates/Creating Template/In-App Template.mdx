- **Subtitle:** Optionally add a subtext to complement your title and provide additional context, enhancing the overall message.

- **Avatar URL:** Customize the notification icon by providing a public URL to the image. Supported file types include `.jpeg` and `.png`, allowing for visual customization.

- **Action URL:** Define the primary action of the notification upon click, providing users with a seamless navigation experience. Specify whether the link should open in the same tab for enhanced user interaction.

- **Additional Data:** Utilize this field to send extra information along with the notification, enabling dynamic content rendering on the device for a personalized user experience.

- **Preview:** Visualize the appearance of your notification to ensure it aligns with your communication objectives and resonates with your target audience.
