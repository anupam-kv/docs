# Templates Overview

Templates serve as a centralized hub for all your message content in Siren. Whether it's for SMS, email, chat, push notifications, or other channels, all content is organized within a single template group for streamlined management. Your template can consist of two types of content:
- **Static Content**: This remains consistent for all users and contains your core message or design.
- **Dynamic Content**: These are placeholders for user or tenant-specific information, such as first names, booking amounts, appointment times, and more. These variables are dynamically populated based on the data provided in your workflow or event request.
