Templates in Siren centralize all your message content—across SMS, email, chat, push notifications, and other supported channels—into a single, reusable structure. This helps ensure consistency in messaging while reducing duplication and manual effort across workflows.

Each template can include two types of content:

- **Static Content**: These are fixed parts of the message that remain the same for every recipient.

- **Dynamic Content**: These are variable placeholders (e.g., `{{firstName}}`, `{{bookingAmount}}`, `{{appointmentTime}}`) that personalize the message based on user-specific or event-driven data. These values are automatically populated using inputs from the workflow or event request, enabling tailored communication at scale.
