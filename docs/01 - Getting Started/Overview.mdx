Welcome to Siren\!

If you are building a product that needs to send notifications -- whether email, SMS, push alerts, or chat messages -- you are in the right place. Siren is a flexible notification platform that helps teams design, automate, and send messages across multiple channels. And the best part? You do not need to spend weeks stitching together different tools -- everything you need is in one place. Let's walk you through the basics so you can get up and running quickly.

Siren is designed to adapt to your team’s workflow — whether you’re setting up onboarding emails, transactional alerts, or multi-step communication flows. With a UI designed for easy and seamless integration, Siren ensures that the right message reaches the right person through the right channel.

## Why Teams choose Siren

- **Simpler APIs with minimal payloads:** Siren makes it easy for developers and systems to integrate with clear, compact API structures. You don’t need to understand deeply nested formats or complex schemas to trigger a workflow or send a message — just pass the essential data, and Siren takes care of the rest.
- **Intuitive notification pipeline builder:** Setting up automated message flows in Siren doesn’t require technical expertise. The intuitive no-code interface lets you design communication journeys visually, helping teams move fast without waiting for code changes.
- **AI agent-ready architecture:** Siren comes with an AI agent toolkit that understands your notification logic and can automatically configure templates, workflows, and messages — enabling deeper automation with less effort.

## What Siren Offers

Siren is made up of a few key parts that work together to help you send smart, scalable notifications without complexity. 

### Workflows

Workflows enable you to define and automate your notification logic. A workflow represents a series of steps that are executed when triggered by either an API call or a scheduled event. These steps determine how and when messages are sent, what content they contain, and through which providers they are delivered.

Using Siren's no-code visual editor, you can build workflows that include:

- Connecting a provider, which defines the external service (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, Slack, Gmail) used for message delivery.
- Linking message templates that determine the content and formatting for each channel.
- Configuring actions, such as introducing delays before sending the message, branching based on conditions, or tracking responses from the recipient.

This setup ensures that your notification system is both flexible and reliable, with full control over the flow and behaviour of every message sent.
