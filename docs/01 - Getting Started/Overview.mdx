Welcome to Siren\!

If you are building a product that needs to send notifications -- whether email, SMS, push alerts, or chat messages -- you are in the right place. Siren is a flexible notification platform that helps teams design, automate, and send messages across multiple channels. And the best part? You do not need to spend weeks stitching together different tools -- everything you need is in one place. Let's walk you through the basics so you can get up and running quickly.

Siren is more than just a notification tool â€“ it is a communication rail purpose-built for the era of AI agents. Imagine an AI agent reading your documentation, understanding your business logic, and building the exact notification workflow you need. That is what Siren is optimized for.

It works as a central hub to:

- Help both humans and agents create, manage, and reuse multi-channel message templates
- Visually define notification workflows using a drag-and-drop interface
- Automate delivery logic based on real-time inputs or external APIs
- Let AI agents auto-configure notifications based on what they learn from Siren's documentation
- Give your team deep visibility into what got sent, what failed, and why
