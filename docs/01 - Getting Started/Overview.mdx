Siren is a communication infrastructure platform purpose-built for **AI agents** and automated systems. Instead of manually integrating multiple messaging providers, Siren acts as the **communication rails**â€”handling message delivery, routing, and orchestration across channels.

It empowers your AI agents to trigger, manage, and optimize real-time communication with users via SMS, Email, WhatsApp, Push, and In-App messagesâ€”all from a single, unified interface.

## Why Siren?

- **Built for AI-Driven Communication:** Enable your agents to engage users contextually, using Sirenâ€™s APIs and SDKs to trigger messages, workflows, and campaigns with precision.
- **Unified Messaging Infrastructure:** Skip the complexity of managing multiple vendor APIs. Siren abstracts channel-level logic and handles provider integration, retries, failovers, and status tracking.
- **Composability & Control:** Design notification flows, manage preferences, and set delivery conditionsâ€”all through intuitive workflows that your AI agents can programmatically control.

## What You Can Do

- **Connect Once, Communicate Everywhere:**
  Use one API to reach users over SMS, Email, WhatsApp, Push, and In-App.
- **Trigger Smart Workflows:**
  Let your agents initiate messaging logic based on user actions, external events, or system states.
- **Manage Campaigns at Scale:**
  Deploy personalized, multi-step messaging campaignsâ€”automated and optimized for engagement.
- **Track & Iterate:**
  Access real-time dashboards and logs to monitor delivery status, user interaction, and performance metrics.

## Use Cases

- **Agent-to-User Communication**
  Equip AI agents with the ability to send real-time alerts, updates, or confirmations directly to users through the most effective channel.
- **Conversational Campaigns**
  Automate messaging sequences driven by user behavior, campaign goals, or AI model outputs.
- **Operational Messaging**
  Schedule and send notifications for reminders, verifications, and system events with full reliability.
