Welcome to Siren\!

If you are building a product that needs to send notifications -- whether email, SMS, push alerts, or chat messages -- you are in the right place. Siren is a flexible notification platform that helps teams design, automate, and send messages across multiple channels. And the best part? You do not need to spend weeks stitching together different tools -- everything you need is in one place. Let's walk you through the basics so you can get up and running quickly.

Siren is designed to adapt to your team’s workflow — whether you’re setting up onboarding emails, transactional alerts, or multi-step communication flows. With a UI designed for easy and seamless integration, Siren ensures that the right message reaches the right person through the right channel.

## Why Teams choose Siren

- **Simpler APIs with minimal payloads:** Siren makes it easy for developers and systems to integrate with clear, compact API structures. You don’t need to understand deeply nested formats or complex schemas to trigger a workflow or send a message — just pass the essential data, and Siren takes care of the rest.
- **Intuitive notification pipeline builder:** Setting up automated message flows in Siren doesn’t require technical expertise. The intuitive no-code interface lets you design communication journeys visually, helping teams move fast without waiting for code changes.
- **AI agent-ready architecture:** Siren includes a dedicated AI agent toolkit that can learn from the documentation and automatically handle backend integration into your systems. Once integrated, the agent can perform a wide range of actions — from sending messages to configuring notification webhooks.

## What Siren Offers

Siren is made up of a few key parts that work together to help you send smart, scalable notifications without complexity.

### Dashboard

The **Siren dashboard** gives you a quick snapshot of your notification system's performance. It shows metrics like total messages sent, delivery rates, channel performance, and workflow activity — all filterable by time range. You can also trigger workflows or campaigns directly from the dashboard, making it a central hub for monitoring and action.

### Templates

Templates in Siren let you create consistent, reusable message formats that work across multiple channels, including Email, SMS, Push, WhatsApp, and more. Instead of writing a new message every time, you define a template once and personalize it with variables like `{{RecipientName}}`.

Each template can support multiple channels within the same definition. For example, you can add an email version and a push notification version of the same message in a single template, each version will have its own channel-specific formatting and content.

You can:

- Create templates from the UI using the built-in editor
- Add and edit content for different channels individually
- Insert variables
- Manage templates via API if you prefer programmatic control
- Ask your AI agent to manage templates for you.

Templates are at the heart of message customisation in Siren. Once created, they can be attached to workflows.

### Workflows

Workflows enable you to define and automate your notification logic. A workflow represents a series of steps that are executed when triggered by either an API call or a scheduled event. These steps determine how and when messages are sent, what content they contain, and through which providers they are delivered.

Using Siren's no-code visual editor, you can build workflows that include:

- **Connecting a provider**, which defines the external service (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, Slack, Gmail) used for message delivery.
- **Linking message templates** that determine the content and formatting for each channel.
- **Configuring actions**, such as introducing delays before sending the message, branching based on conditions, or tracking responses from the recipient.

This setup ensures that your notification system is both flexible and reliable, with full control over the flow and behaviour of every message sent.

### Providers

Siren supports a wide range of communication channels like Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Push, Chat, In-App. You can send messages through any of these channels individually or combine them within the same workflow to create multi-channel notification experiences.

Each channel is mapped to one or more **providers**, which are the third-party services responsible for delivering the actual messages. For example, you might use SendGrid for Email, MessageBird for SMS, or OneSignal for Push. Siren allows you to configure and manage these provider connections.

Here is a list of providers that Siren gives:

- \*\*EMAIL \*\*- Gmail, Mailchimp, Mailgun, Outlook, Postmark, SendGrid, SES
- **SMS** - Kaleyra.io, MessageBird, MSG91, Plivo, Twilio
- \*\*WHATSAPP \*\*- GUPSHUP, Meta, MSG91, Twilio, WATI
- \*\*PUSH \*\*- FCM, OneSignal
- **CHAT** - Discord, Line, Microsoft Teams, Slack

Siren also offers an In-App channel that works directly within your Siren account.

### Campaign

Campaigns let you define and message a targeted group of users, whether you're sending a daily update, a special promotion, or an announcement. You can create your audience using an existing cohort or build a new one by importing user data from your database or a CSV file.

Siren also offers a built-in Campaign AI that generates personalized campaigns for you. Just describe your goal in conversational language, and it will configure the campaign, all tailored to your use case.

### Cohort

A **cohort** in Siren is a group of users who share common attributes or behaviors — such as signing up recently, using a specific feature, or coming from a certain region. Organizing users into cohorts helps you send more relevant, targeted messages.

You can create cohorts in several ways:

- **Manually**: Add users through the UI or upload a CSV file
- **Mixpanel integration**: Import behavior-based cohorts you've already created
- **Data source connection**: Sync cohorts directly from databases or warehouses like PostgreSQL, BigQuery, or Snowflake

Whether you’re sending a reminder to users who abandoned checkout or announcing a feature to premium users in India, cohorts help ensure your messages reach the right audience with precision.

### Workspace

A **workspace** in Siren is a dedicated environment where you manage your templates, workflows, users, and campaigns. Siren provides three built-in workspaces:

- **Sandbox** – for early exploration and experiments
- **Staging** – for testing workflows and templates before going live
- **Production** – for sending live notifications to real users

Each workspace is isolated from the others, allowing you to build, test, and deploy safely without impacting your production data or users.
