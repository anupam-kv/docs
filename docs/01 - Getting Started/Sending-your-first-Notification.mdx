Upon registration, Siren automatically sets up a default provider, template, and workflow for your organization. Here's how you can access them:

1. Log in to your Siren dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate to the **"Providers"** section.  
   - You'll find a default provider named `organisationName_sampleProvider` already created for you.  
   - **Note:** The default provider allows you to send up to **50 transactions** per organization.
3. Go to the **"Templates"** section.  
   - Here, you'll see a sample template named `organisationName_sampleTemplate` pre-configured for you.  
   - **Note:** The sample template contains a default subject line:
     ```
     "Welcome to Siren"
     ```
     and message content:
     ```
     "Hi {userName}, This is a sample email triggered using Siren."
     ```  
     You can customize it according to your preferences.
4. Visit the **"Workflows"** section.  
   - You'll find a sample workflow named `organisationName_sampleWorkflow_1` already set up for you.  
   - **Note:** The sample workflow is structured to trigger an email notification using the sample template.
