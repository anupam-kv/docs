### Step 1: [Create your Siren account](https://app.trysiren.io/sign-up)

You can sign up using Gmail or GitHub.

### Step 2: Backend Integrations

- **SDK Integration:** Use the Siren SDK to trigger workflows and manage communication directly from your backend.\
  [Go to SDK Documentation](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/SDK)
- \*\*MCP Server Setup: \*\*Integrate the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to allow AI agents to learn from our documentation.\
  [Go to MCP Integration](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/MCP%20Server)
- \*\*AI Agent Toolkit Integration: \*\*Now, let's integrate your own AI Agent. [see how](/docs/MCP)

### Step 3: Generate API Key and Token

After logging in:

1. Go to the **right panel** → **Settings** → **Configurations**.
2. Click on **"Add API Key"**.
3. Enter a name for your API key.
4. An **API Token** will be generated.

<Warning>
  Save this token securely — it is required for authenticating all API requests. See [API Reference](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/API%20Reference)
</Warning>

### Step 4: Set Up Providers

<Info>
  By default, there will be a provider '**Sample Email Provider**' setup under the Email channel.
</Info>

1. In the **left panel**, go to **Settings** → **Providers**.
2. You'll see available **channels** (SMS, Email, Push, etc.)
3. Under each channel, select a **provider** and click **"Add Account"**.
4. Enter the required credentials or API details. [View the Provider Setup Guide](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/Providers) for more details

<Note>
  **_Note_**: You can add up to **5 accounts** across all providers.
</Note>

You're now ready to create workflows and start communicating with your users\! but Siren gives you an option to send notifications using APIs without creating a workflow. The next section gives you a birds eye view of how to send message using API.

## Send Message using API

You can use Siren's `POST /send-messages` API to send a notification without setting up a workflow. This lets you directly send messages to user over your desired channel with or without using a predefined template.

To send a message, you just need to include the channel, recipient details (matching that channel), and optionally a template name with variables — as shown below. The request must be authorized using your API key, which should be included in the header as:

`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`

Once sent, Siren will return a `notificationId`, which you can use to check the message status or fetch replies

Here's a simplified example:

```json
{
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "recipient": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "template": {
    "name": "welcome_template"
  },
  "templateVariables": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "offerCode": "ABCD123"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  If you're not using the default provider configured in the Siren account, you can specify which provider to use by adding the `providerIntegration` field in the request. Refer to [API Reference](/docs/API-References) for the details.
</Note>

Once a message is sent, you can use the following endpoints to track it:

- `GET /message-status/{id}` - Check whether the message was delivered, failed, or is still pending.
- `GET /get-reply/{notificationId}` - Fetch replies to a message (currently supported for Slack only). This includes main messages and threaded responses from users.

These endpoints help you build a full feedback loop between your system, the provider, and the user. Refer [API References](/docs/API-References) for the complete details.
