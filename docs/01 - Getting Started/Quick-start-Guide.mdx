### Step 3: Send Your First Message

There are multiple ways to integrate Siren and start sending messages:

- **MCP Server Integration**\
  Connect your MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to let AI agents learn from your internal documentation and handle automation intelligently.\
  [Learn more](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/MCP%20Server)
- **SDK Integration**\
  Use the Siren SDK to trigger workflows, send messages, and manage notifications directly from your backend.\
  [Go to SDK Docs](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/SDK)
- **AI Agent Toolkit**\
  Integrate your AI agent to automatically configure workflows, manage templates, and handle notification logic based on your internal context.\
  [See AI Toolkit Setup](/docs/MCP)
- **Send via API**\
  Siren provides simple and flexible APIs to send messages with or without a predefined workflow. You can send one-off messages, trigger workflows, or schedule campaigns using lightweight payloads.\
