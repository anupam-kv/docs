### 4. Send Your First Message

You can start sending messages in multiple ways, depending on how you want to integrate:

#### • MCP Server

Connect the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to let tools interact with Siren through function calls — for messaging, templates, users, workflows, and webhooks.\
[Learn more](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/MCP%20Server)

#### • AI Agent Toolkit

After integrating the AI agent toolkit, you can go to your LLM or Conversational AI and give a prompt to send message with the details. \
[See Toolkit Setup](/docs/MCP)

#### • SDK

Use the Siren Python SDK to call built-in functions for sending messages and triggering workflows directly from your backend.\
[Go to SDK Docs](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/SDK)

#### • API

Use Siren’s flexible, lightweight APIs to send messages without creating a full workflow. You can trigger one-off notifications using APIs. Go to [QuickSend ](/docs/01 - Getting Started/QuickSend)to see how to send message using APIs
