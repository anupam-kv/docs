### 3. Customize Your Templates

Templates are the heart of your messaging content:

- Utilize our user-friendly template editor to craft and modify templates seamlessly.
- Whether static or dynamic with placeholders for replaceable data points, Siren templates make messaging efficient.

> **Note:**  
> We use `{{ }}` or `{{{ }}}` as placeholders.
> 
> - Use `{{expression}}` for HTML-escaped output.  
> - Use `{{{expression}}}` for raw, unescaped output.  
> 
> **Example:**  
> `Your Secure Delivery Code is {{code}} and it's valid for the next 30 minutes. Enter this Delivery Code on the device to receive the package.`
