# Quick Start Guide

Let us get you up and running in few simple steps:

---

### Step 1: [Create your Siren account](https://app.trysiren.io/sign-up)

You can sign up using Gmail or GitHub.

### Step 2: Backend Integrations

#### SDK Integration

Use the Siren SDK to trigger workflows and manage communication directly from your backend.\
[Go to SDK Documentation](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/SDK)

#### MCP Server Setup

Integrate the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to allow AI agents to learn from our documentation.\
[Go to MCP Integration](https://docs.trysiren.io/docs/MCP%20Server)
