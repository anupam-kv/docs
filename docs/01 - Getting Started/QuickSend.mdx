## QuickSend

Need to send a critical update or one-off announcement? You can use Siren's `POST /send-messages` API to send a notification without setting up a workflow. This lets you directly send messages to a user over your desired channel with or without using a predefined template.

To send a message, you just need to include the channel, recipient details (matching that channel), and optionally a template name with variables, as shown below. The request must be authorized using your API key, which should be included in the header as:

`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`

Once sent, Siren will return a `notificationId`, which you can use to check the message status or fetch replies

Here's a simplified example:

```json
{
  "channel": "EMAIL",
  "recipient": {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "template": {
    "name": "welcome_template"
  },
  "templateVariables": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "offerCode": "ABCD123"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  If you're not using the default provider configured in the Siren account, you can specify which provider to use by adding the `providerIntegration` field in the request. Please take a look at [API Reference](/docs/API-References) for the details.
</Note>

Once a message is sent, you can use the following endpoints to track it:

- `GET /message-status/{id}` - Check whether the message was delivered, failed, or is still pending.
- `GET /get-reply/{notificationId}` - Fetch replies to a message (currently supported for Slack only). This includes main messages and threaded responses from users.

These endpoints help you build a full feedback loop between your system, the provider, and the user. For the complete details, refer to  [API Reference](/docs/API-References).

For more complex orchestration, you can utilise the workflow editor and start [designing your own notification workflow](/docs/01 - Getting Started/QuickSend).
