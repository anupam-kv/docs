## How it works

Siren promptly sends a JSON payload to your specified endpoint (URL) whenever a notification update occurs, such as message sending, delivery, user interaction, or replies. Once received, Siren triggers a POST request to your designated endpoint, empowering you to store information or initiate specific actions within your application.
