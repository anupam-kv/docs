# Channel Overview

Siren supports multiple messaging channels, allowing you to reach users where they areâ€”whether that's in their inbox, on their phone, or inside your app. Channels represent the medium of communication and serve as the foundation for your notification strategy.
You can configure and manage channels from the Siren dashboard, making it easy to customize how and where notifications are delivered.
See Channel Details for supported channels and integration specifics.
