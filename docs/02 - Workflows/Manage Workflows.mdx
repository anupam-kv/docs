## Tag Workflow

Tags help you categorize workflows for better organization and discovery. By assigning relevant tags during creation, you can easily filter workflows and surface matching templates when building new ones.

![Tag Workflow](../Images/Workflow/WorkflowsTag.png)


### How to Tag Workflows

1. Assign Tags During Workflow Creation

    - Add tags while creating a new workflow.
    - Select from existing tags or create new ones as needed.
    - Apply **multiple tags** to a single workflow for broader categorization.

2. Color-Coded Tags

    - Tags are color-coded for quick visual recognition.
    - Choose from a predefined set of colors, similar to template tagging.

3. Edit Tags Anytime

    After creation, you can:

    - Add or remove tags  
    - Rename tags  
    - Change tag colors  

#### Using Tags to Filter and Search

- **Filter Workflows**: View workflows by filtering based on assigned tags.
- **Search Templates by Tags**: During workflow setup, templates with matching tags will appear first in search results.
- **Clone Tags**: Easily duplicate tags to maintain consistency across workflows.

>**_Note:_** When a **workflow and a template share the same tag**, those templates are automatically prioritized in the template search during workflow creation. This enables smarter, faster setup by narrowing suggestions to only relevant templates.


### Best Practices

- Use consistent tag naming across templates and workflows to fully benefit from automated matching.
- Limit the number of tags per workflow to maintain clarity.
- Reuse tags rather than creating new variations to enable better filtering.
