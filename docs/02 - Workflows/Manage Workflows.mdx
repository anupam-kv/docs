## Tag Workflow

Organize and streamline your workflow management using tags — a powerful way to categorize workflows and automatically surface relevant templates.

### How to Tag Workflows

1. Assign Tags During Workflow Creation

    - Add tags while creating a new workflow.
    - Select from existing tags or create new ones as needed.
    - Apply **multiple tags** to a single workflow for broader categorization.

2. Color-Coded Tags

    - Tags are color-coded for quick visual recognition.
    - Choose from a predefined set of colors, similar to template tagging.

3. Edit Tags Anytime

    After creation, you can:

    - Add or remove tags  
    - Rename tags  
    - Change tag colors  

#### Using Tags to Filter and Search

- **Filter Workflows**: View workflows by filtering based on assigned tags.
- **Search Templates by Tags**: During workflow setup, templates with matching tags will appear first in search results.
- **Clone Tags**: Easily duplicate tags to maintain consistency across workflows.

>**_Note:_** When a **workflow and a template share the same tag**, those templates are automatically prioritized in the template search during workflow creation. This enables smarter, faster setup by narrowing suggestions to only relevant templates.


### Best Practices

- Use consistent tag naming across templates and workflows to fully benefit from automated matching.
- Limit the number of tags per workflow to maintain clarity.
- Reuse tags rather than creating new variations to enable better filtering.
