## Tag Workflow

Organize and streamline your workflow management using tags — a powerful way to categorize workflows and automatically surface relevant templates.

![Tag Workflow](../Images/Workflow/WorkflowsTag.png)


### How to Tag Workflows

1. Assign Tags During Workflow Creation

    - Add tags while creating a new workflow.
    - Select from existing tags or create new ones as needed.
    - Apply **multiple tags** to a single workflow for broader categorization.

2. Color-Coded Tags

    - Tags are color-coded for quick visual recognition.
    - Choose from a predefined set of colors, similar to template tagging.

3. Edit Tags Anytime

    After creation, you can:

    - Add or remove tags  
    - Rename tags  
    - Change tag colors  

#### Using Tags to Filter and Search

- **Filter Workflows**: View workflows by filtering based on assigned tags.
- **Search Templates by Tags**: During workflow setup, templates with matching tags will appear first in search results.
- **Clone Tags**: Easily duplicate tags to maintain consistency across workflows.

>**_Note:_** When a **workflow and a template share the same tag**, those templates are automatically prioritized in the template search during workflow creation. This enables smarter, faster setup by narrowing suggestions to only relevant templates.


### Best Practices

- Use consistent tag naming across templates and workflows to fully benefit from automated matching.
- Limit the number of tags per workflow to maintain clarity.
- Reuse tags rather than creating new variations to enable better filtering.

## Schedule Workflows

Automate the execution of workflows in Siren by scheduling them to run at specific dates and times. This enables efficient task management and ensures timely execution without manual intervention.

### Creating a Schedule

Click on the **Add Schedule** button to create a new schedule:

1. Enter a **Schedule Name** when prompted.
2. After saving, you’ll be redirected to the **Schedule Detail Page**.

### Schedule Detail Page

The **Schedule Detail Page** displays all configuration options and metadata for a specific schedule:

- **Schedule Name**: The name assigned to the schedule.
- **Workflow Name**: The workflow that will be triggered by this schedule.
- **Start Date and Time Zone**: The date/time from which the schedule becomes active and its time zone context.
- **Scheduling Frequency**:  
  Choose how often the workflow should run:  
  - `Once`  
  - `Daily`  
  - `Weekly`  
  - `Monthly`  
  - `Custom`
- **Schedule Time**: The exact time of day when the workflow should run.
- **End Options**:  
  - `Never`: The schedule continues indefinitely.  
  - `After a specific date`: Define an explicit end date.
- **JSON Body (Optional)**: Input a JSON payload to be passed when the workflow is triggered.
- **Pause and Resume**: Temporarily disable or resume the schedule as needed.

### Schedule Frequencies

#### ONCE

- These schedules execute **only once**, based on the specified configuration.
- Required fields for ONCE schedules:
  - **Workflow Name**
  - **Start Date and Time Zone**
  - **Schedule Time**
