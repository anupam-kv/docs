In Siren, a **workflow** is a structured automation that controls how notifications are delivered across multiple channels. It allows you to define step-by-step logic—including delays, conditional paths, external API calls, and content personalization—so messages reach the right users, through the right medium, at the right time. Workflows reduce manual setup, support complex campaign logic, and can be triggered reliably via a single API call.

## Workflow Types

### Basic Workflows
Designed for quick setup with a predefined structure. Ideal for simple campaigns like updates or reminders. JSON values can be adjusted, but variable structure remains fixed.

### Advanced Workflows
Built for flexibility, these allow full customization of logic, including HTTP nodes, branching conditions, and external data integrations. Suitable for developers managing complex, dynamic flows.
